However, by disabling cookies, you may not have access to the entire set of features of the Site.
          
          Generally, we use cookies to customize your experience on our Site and to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site.
          
          In addition, our business partners may use cookies to provide us with anonymous data and information regarding the use of our Site. Specifically, some of our business partners use cookies to show Livigro ads on other sites on the internet as a result of you using the Site. Such cookies do not contain any Personal Information. You may opt out of receiving cookies placed by such third-party vendors by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.
